## DATA PROTECTION

### GENERAL

Beaviour Twin use cases usually utilize usage data. Therefore, data
protection laws must be complied with.
In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) must be observed.

In general, users of data must have obtained consent from the data owner
for each type of processing separately.
If a data provider gets a request for passing along or processing usage data,
it must ensure, that the data owner has given consent for the requested
purpose. A automated consent system may be implemented.

Also note that usage data in a vehicle may be generated by other persons
(drivers) than the vehicle owner.

### ACCESS DATA BY VIN

Currently, to acces usage data of a vehicle from outside the data provider,
the vehicle identification number (VIN) would be needed.
Until the release of the current KIT version, there is no general legally
permissible option for using VINs to obtain usage data. A regulation
is under discussion.

In individual cases, the usage of a VIN or some generated anonymized number
may be possible.

## DATA SOVEREIGNTY

In genearl, the supply chain is not fully visible to the companies involved.
The visibility is at least one up and one down:

![supply chain visibility](assets/supply-chain-visibility.drawio.svg)

To engage additional actors in the supply chain, the framework agreements
and other requirements must be propagated througt the chain.

## DATA QUALITY

Data quality depends on many factors. In some use cases, a minimum data
quality must be ensured. Currently, there is no general concept for this.
Some aspects should be kept in mind:

- **Type of data acquisition:** The data could be measured, calculated,
  estimated, processed, replaced ... The accuracy may vary and data
  could be currupted.

- **Availability:** The data could be fully or partially missing.

- **Stability:** For example, data may be accumulated and therefore
  monotonically increasing. Data could be resetted or currupted
  unintentionally or due to system fault.

- **Quality propagation:** Calculated/processed data may be based on
  input data that are for example estimated. Without a quality indicator,
  the quality may vary very greatly from an alternative source where
  the base was a meassurement.

- **Error propagation:** With the Knowledge Agent, errors are not
  propagated by default. If some data is not available, an empty set
  is returned. If, for example, a service uses a variable number of
  parameters, and one of them is not available, a wrong result may
  be generated. If the result is then processed further, this issue
  will not be noticeable.
