Gain deep insights into the Catena-X architecture and actively contribute your ideas to practical participation opportunities (use cases, KITs, services).\\n\\n### What awaits you \\nThe agenda includes short keynote speeches with highly interesting technical insights, deep dives for a practical introduction to open-source programming topics and IT tools (our Open-Source Tractus-X KITs) and, above all, workshops in which you can become active and code yourself. You can bring your own challenges (please coordinate with us beforehand). At the evening event on the first day you can network, talk shop, code until late into the night - and of course just have fun. \\n\\n![eclipse tractus x logo](@site/static/img/Eclipse_CommunityDay1.png)\\n![eclipse tractus x logo](@site/static/img/Eclipse_CommunityDay2.png)\\n\\n\\n### Who meets here \\n- Developers who use Tractus-X or want to participate.\\n- Service or solution providers who want to participate in the Catena-X ecosystem. \\n- Data providers who want to provide data in the right format and with the right semantics.\\n- Those responsible for the planning and development of products (product owners or product managers) who want to learn how projects are planned in open source.\\n\\nYou belong to one of the above, then you are exactly right here. With the support of experts and in exchange with like-minded people, you can actively test the possibilities of Tractus-X and the Catena-X KITs. But of course, other technology-loving participants with an interest in sovereign data exchange are also welcomed.\\n\\n### How you can participate\\nIf you would like to join, please register for free via Eventbrite [LINK]. The number of places is limited, so it is worth being quick!\\n\\n### Contact\\nIf you have any questions about the event, please contact heike.wohlfeld@arena2036.de. \\n\\n**Get to know the developer community live and network with like-minded people - we look forward to your creativity and contributions! \\nYour Tractus-X Team**\\n\\n### Presenters of the event\\nThis is an Eclipse Tractus-X event, which takes place within the framework of the Catena-X Automotive Network consortium project (funding code: 13IK004*) and the Catena-X Automotive Network e.V.. ARENA2036 will host the event on its premises and contribute its data space activities (ARENA-X)."},{"id":"new-release-23.09","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/new-release-23.09","editUrl":"https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/tree/main/blog/2023-09-08-release-23.09.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-08-release-23.09.md","title":"Tractus-X 23.09 available now","description":"Release Tractus-X 23.09 announcement","date":"2023-09-08T11:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 8, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":0.87,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Miehle","title":"Tractus-X Project Lead","url":"https://github.com/danielmiehle","image_url":"https://github.com/danielmiehle.png","email":"daniel.miehle@bmw.de","imageURL":"https://github.com/danielmiehle.png"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Tractus-X 23.09 available now","description":"Release Tractus-X 23.09 announcement","slug":"new-release-23.09","date":"2023-09-08T11:00","hide_table_of_contents":false,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Miehle","title":"Tractus-X Project Lead","url":"https://github.com/danielmiehle","image_url":"https://github.com/danielmiehle.png","email":"daniel.miehle@bmw.de","imageURL":"https://github.com/danielmiehle.png"}]},"prevItem":{"title":"First Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days","permalink":"/blog/community-days"},"nextItem":{"title":"Tractus-X 3.1 available now","permalink":"/blog/new-release-3-1-0"}},"content":"![eclipse tractus x logo](@site/static/img/release_23.09.png)\\n\\nWe are pleased to announce the [Tractus-X Release 23.09!](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractus-x-release/releases/tag/23.09) This release brings important improvements to our Catena-X operating system and KITs in terms of robustness, data sovereignty, compliance, and overall user experience for all data space participants.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Catena-X Operating System (cxOS):\\n\\nWe are introducing a decentralized registry for digital twins and a managed identity wallet based on self-sovereign identities to **maximize sovereignty** of all data space participants.
